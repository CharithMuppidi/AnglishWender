French word	English word	Example derivatives	Notes
-ery (place)	house	bakery > bakehouse	For some words, a word other than house may be better, e.g., fishery > fishstead.
-ess	-en	priestess > priesten	A native feminine ending that survives only in vixen (originally a dialectal variant of fixen, feminine of fox) and archaic minchen (feminine of monk).
Note that goddess is now gidden from OE gyden (derived from god and showing umlaut).
For the feminine equivalent of -er, one can use -eren (e.g., huntress > hunteren) or use -ster (e.g., huntress > huntster), which was originially a feminine agent suffix before it lost its feminine meaning in Middle English. It is uncertain whether this loss is connected to the rise of -ess.
-ic (adjectival suffix)	-ish	Hellenic > Hellenish	Based on how Old English and other Germanic languages often use -ish to translate Latin -icus.
Note that the main stress is now on the first syllable.
-ly may also work, but for nationalities and languages, -ish should be used, so Icelandic is now Icelandish.
-ical is a variant formed with -al and can often be replaced with -ish or -ly (if needed for differentiation).
-ment (from verbs)	-ing	acknowledgment > acknowledging	
-ment (from adjectives)	-ness	merriment > merriness
